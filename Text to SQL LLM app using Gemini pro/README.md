# Text to SQL APP using Google Gemini Pro

This project is a Streamlit web application that allows users to ask questions based on the database and it will generate the corresponding **SQL query** using **Google Gemini pro** model and execute it on a **SQLite database**.

## üöÄ Features
- Converts **English questions ‚Üí SQL queries** using `gemini-2.5-pro` model.
- Runs the generated SQL on a **SQLite database**.
- Displays query results in the Streamlit UI.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. The user asks a question "What is the average marks of all students"
2. The app sends a question to google gemini model.
3. The model returns the SQL query:
   `SELECT AVG(MARKS) FROM STUDENT`
4. The app runs the query on SQLite database and generates an answer for the user query.

### üí° Example Queries
1. How many entries of records are present?
2. Tell me all students studying in "Data science"
3. Give me a list of students scored marks more than 90
